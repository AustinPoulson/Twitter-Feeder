# Twitter-Feeder
This is a script that searches through posts on Reddit, filters them, and posts the titles or pictures on twitter. The ideal use case is for situations where the actual text of a post isn't neccesary. Some examples are news headlines and infographics. Future iterations may be added as they're created.
